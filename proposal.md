> There is this website called Human Benchmark at humanbenchmark.com/tests/aim, which doesn't feature a crosshair function or multiple modes to train aim.

> aimtrainer.io features a crosshair(not customisable) and multiple modes to train aim in.

> If possible I would like to develop this application in 3D, but I would be limited in terms of hardware as well,
