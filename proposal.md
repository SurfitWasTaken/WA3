# General description of project
> Aim training platform, where users have to click targets on the screen rapidly.
> 
# Goals of project
> Improve the user's aim over time,

> Improve user's reaction time
# Listing of features
> 1. Crosshair for aim assistance(customisable if possible)

> 2. show what percentile the user is in, in comparison to global data.

> 3. Have multiple modes fo train aim: 
> e.g. Stationary targets,
> moving targets
> targets of varying sizes.

> 4. Provide personalised reports, based on the user's performance.

# External Scanning
> There is this website called Human Benchmark at humanbenchmark.com/tests/aim, which doesn't feature a crosshair function or multiple modes to train aim.

> aimtrainer.io features a crosshair(not customisable) and multiple modes to train aim in.

> If possible I would like to develop this application in 3D, but I would be limited in terms of hardware.

# Listing of Key Use Cases
> eSports professionals who would like to improve their aim so that they can unleash their full potential in First Person Shooters can use this platform.

> Casual use would also improve a person's reaction time, thus improving their reactime to stimuli in the real world.

# Skills that my project requires me to pick up
> I need to learn C# as well as 
> how to use Unity hub
>
