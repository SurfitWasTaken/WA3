# General description of project
> Aim training platform, where users have to click targets on the screen rapidly.
> 
# Goals of project
> Improve the user's aim over time,

> Improve user's reaction time
# Listing of features
> 1. Crosshair for aim assistance(customisable if possible)

> 2. show what percentile the user is in, in comparison to global data.

> 3. Have multiple modes fo train aim: 
> e.g. Stationary targets,
> moving targets
> targets of varying sizes.

> 4. Provide personalised reports, based on the user's performance.

# External Scanning
> There is this website called Human Benchmark at humanbenchmark.com/tests/aim, which doesn't feature a crosshair function or multiple modes to train aim.

> aimtrainer.io features a crosshair(not customisable) and multiple modes to train aim in.

> If possible I would like to develop this application in 3D, but I would be limited in terms of hardware.

# Listing of Key Use Cases
> eSports professionals who would like to improve their aim so that they can unleash their full potential in First Person Shooters can use this platform.

> Casual use would also improve a person's reaction time, thus improving their reactime to stimuli in the real world.

# Skills that my project requires me to pick up
> I need to learn C# as well as 
> how to use Unity hub
> 

# [Development Log](/devlog.md)
> You will be updating this section regularly
> - Week 5

>   Goals set: Create scene, define player movement.

> Problem encountered: Unity wass extremely slow, hanged every few minutes.   

> Goals for next week: Create target system(Target spawning, target destruction)



> - Week 6

>   Goals set: Come up with the target system(Spawning and destruction of targets)
  
> I needed to get used to C#

> Goals for next week: Implement Crosshair, Introduce colours in scene.
> 
> - Week 7
> I literally didn't do anything this week. I took a break for this week because I couldn't find my file in unity, so i gave up after a while. I wanted to do the crpsshair this week, and add in colours in the scene this week, but after some thought, I want the background of the aimtrainer to be not be distracting so it will just be gray. Next week, I intend to implement the crosshair system and include user generated variables, so the user will be able to control the target size and colour
