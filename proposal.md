# General description of project
> Aim training platform, where users have to click targets on the screen rapidly.
> 
# Goals of project
> Improve the user's aim over time,

> Improve user's reaction time
# Listing of features
> 1. Crosshair for aim assistance(customisable if possible)

> 2. show what percentile the user is in, in comparison to global data.

> 3. Have multiple modes fo train aim: 
> e.g. Stationary targets,
> moving targets
> targets of varying sizes.

> 4. Provide personalised reports, based on the user's performance.

# External Scanning
> There is this website called Human Benchmark at humanbenchmark.com/tests/aim, which doesn't feature a crosshair function or multiple modes to train aim.

> aimtrainer.io features a crosshair(not customisable) and multiple modes to train aim in.

> If possible I would like to develop this application in 3D, but I would be limited in terms of hardware.

# Listing of Key Use Cases
> eSports professionals who would like to improve their aim so that they can unleash their full potential in First Person Shooters can use this platform.

> Casual use would also improve a person's reaction time, thus improving their reactime to stimuli in the real world.

# Skills that my project requires me to pick up
> I need to learn C# as well as 
> how to use Unity hub
> 

# [Development Log](/devlog.md)
> You will be updating this section regularly
> - Week 5

>   Goals set: Create scene, define player movement.

> Problem encountered: Unity wass extremely slow, hanged every few minutes.   

> Goals for next week: Create target system(Target spawning, target destruction)



> - Week 6

>   Goals set: Come up with the target system(Spawning and destruction of targets)
  
> I needed to get used to C#

> Goals for next week: Implement Crosshair, Introduce colours in scene.
> 
> - Week 7

> I literally didn't do anything this week. I took a break for this week because I couldn't find my file in unity, so i gave up after a while. I wanted to do the crosshair this week, and add in colours in the scene this week, but after some thought, I want the background of the aimtrainer to be not be distracting so it will just be gray. Next week, I intend to implement the crosshair system and include user generated variables, so the user will be able to control the target size and colour


> - Week 8

> Hello! So here are the stuff I have accomplished over the past week:

> 1) Upside -> Implemented a working crosshair! Downside -> Crosshair isnt actually a crosshair, just a dot in the middle of the screen, (as an UI image). I would like the user to be able to change his crosshair as he would like, but I'm presuming that's a bit too ambitious. Instead, I want to have preset variables that the player can choose from, in order to customise his crosshair. -> The UI canvas(the crosshair is an UI image under the UI canvas) is glitching, I'm not so sure why. It's outlined in white, even when not selected. 2) Coming up with user generated variables, as I have come to realise. I need to reference to a lot more content before I can finally decide how I'm going to go about it. A few of the user generated variables that the aimtrainer would aim to utilise: target size, crosshair, colour of targets, and so on...
